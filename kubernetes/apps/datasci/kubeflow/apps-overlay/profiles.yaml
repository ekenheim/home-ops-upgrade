# At least one Profile is required so the Central Dashboard shows namespaces and the
# side panel (Notebooks, Pipelines, Katib, etc.). Without any Profile, the dashboard
# shows "no namespaces" and hides the menu. team-1 and team-1-prod (DeployKF) were
# removed; this default profile provides a working namespace for the dashboard.
